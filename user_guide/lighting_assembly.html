    <p>The light source assembly consists of two different color LEDs which are set up, using a filter, to shine in the same direction. Instructions for assembling the LEDs can be found at the <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2692#5EB27966-73A8-41C2-B447-52AD3CD6723C-2692">Thorlabs website</a>, under "Multi-LED source". A diffuser (DG10-220-MD Ã˜1",   SM1-Mounted N-BK7 Ground Glass Diffuser, 220 Grit) is mounted onto the exit of the cube, to produce even illumination across the back of the imaging region. For the backlight assembly, the entire assembly is mounted on a post, and the post is fixed to the right edge of the Shopbot platform, in line with the camera and nozzle.</p>
    
    <p>Each LED is wired to a separate <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LEDD1B">power controller</a>. The LEDs can be turned on by turning the knob on the power controller to the desired intensity.</p>

    <p>For the sheet illumination assembly, the LED assembly is fixed to a post at the end of the sheet illumination rail. The sheet illumination assembly approximately follows <a href="https://openspim.org/">OpenSPIM</a>.</p>
