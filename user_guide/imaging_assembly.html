    <h2>Light source</h2>
    <p>The light source assembly consists of two different color LEDs which are set up, using a filter, to shine in the same direction. Instructions for assembling the LEDs can be found at the <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2692#5EB27966-73A8-41C2-B447-52AD3CD6723C-2692">Thorlabs website</a>, under "Multi-LED source". A diffuser (DG10-220-MD Ã˜1",   SM1-Mounted N-BK7 Ground Glass Diffuser, 220 Grit) is mounted onto the exit of the cube, to produce even illumination across the back of the imaging region. For the backlight assembly, the entire assembly is mounted on a post, and the post is fixed to the right edge of the Shopbot platform, in line with the camera and nozzle.</p>
    
    <p>Each LED is wired to a separate <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LEDD1B">power controller</a>. The LEDs can be turned on by turning the knob on the power controller to the desired intensity. Each LED controller is plugged into a standard outlet.</p>

    <p>For the sheet illumination assembly, the LED assembly is fixed to a post at the end of the sheet illumination rail. The sheet illumination assembly approximately follows <a href="https://openspim.org/">OpenSPIM</a>.</p>

    <h2>Camera</h2>
    
    
    
    <p>The camera (<a href="https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/basler-ace-aca800-510uc-color-usb-30-camera/3417/">Basler ace acA800-510uc Color USB 3.0 Camera</a>) has a 800x600 px color resolution and maximum frame rate of 511 fps. Depending on the exposure time, e.g. in dim lighting, the actual frame rate may be lower. The camera is connected to the computer via micro-B USB 3.0. The camera is connected to an objective (<a href="https://www.edmundoptics.com/p/vzmtrade-450i-zoom-imaging-lens/11340/">VZM 450i Zoom imaging lens</a>). The knob on the objective can be used to adjust the zoom of the objective. The objective is mounted on a 3-axis stage. The lower left knob moves the camera forward and backward and is the primary way to focus the camera. The front knob moves the camera left/right, and the top knob moves the camera up/down.</p>
